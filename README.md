# Spring-boot-vue-blog-rest-api

**A blog build by Vue.js and Spring Boot**

 This is a side project about Spring boot backend and Vue.js frontend Web Application with JWT. Just practice : )

* Spring Boot
* JPA
* HikariCP
* Vue 4
* Bootstrap
* v-md-editor
* MariaDB
* Redis
 
# ðŸš€Development

Before start this project please make sure MariaDB, Redis is running on you PC. If you not, do it (in this case use Manjaro for example) .

```

# update and install docker 
sudo pacman -Syu Docker

# pull latest mariadb and redis image 
Docker pull mariadb redis

```

You also need jdk, maven, ide, node in your development environment. I really want to list all steps, but I need to pay more attention on other work. I would like to write a more detail development files in future.

# TODO

This project would not update in near future. I think I got enough practice on this project and this inspired me for my next project.
